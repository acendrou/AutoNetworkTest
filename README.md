# AutoNetworkTest


Simple python app for automating network testing, in a network test environment (like EVE-NG). In alpha stage / only proof of concept at this point.

Write your tests as scenarios in a file and let the tool perform them automatically. It reports failure and success of test.
Write your tests with names directly coming from your EVE-NG labs.

See test1.test for an example of two scenarios: two ping between three machines.
